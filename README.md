# Loan Approval Prediction Machine Learning Project

Welcome to the Loan Approval Prediction Machine Learning Project! This project aims to predict loan approval based on a comprehensive set of features using a variety of machine learning algorithms. It was developed as part of academic coursework and is designed to provide insights into the fascinating world of data science and predictive modeling.


## About the Project

The Loan Approval Prediction Project is a data-driven endeavor that explores the intricate process of predicting whether a loan application will be approved or denied. It leverages a diverse dataset encompassing various attributes such as applicant details, loan amount, credit history, and more. By applying a range of machine learning algorithms, this project endeavors to classify loan applications effectively.


## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these instructions.

### Prerequisites

- Python (3.6+)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn, xgboost

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: 
   git clone https://github.com/HeliKheni/LoanApprovalPredication.git
2. Change directory to the project folder:
  cd LoanApprovalPrediction
Install the required libraries using pip:
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  
### Algorithms
This project incorporates a diverse range of machine learning algorithms, each with its unique approach to the loan approval prediction task. The algorithms used include:

- Logistic Regression: A fundamental classification algorithm.
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A simple but powerful instance-based learning algorithm.
- Random Forest: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees.
- Decision Tree: A tree-based model used for classification and regression tasks.
- Neural Network (MLP): A deep learning model capable of handling complex patterns and relationships.

### Results
Each algorithm's performance is evaluated using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. You can find the detailed results in the notebook.
